<h1>Don't Prioritize Color Over Content</h1>
<p>This is a recorded version of my presentation from CSUN Assistive Technologies Conference 2024. It is not a recording from the conference, but rather a video I put together myself that includes the slides and dialogue. Since I'm reading word-for-word from my slide notes, this video differs from the actual CSUN presentation, but the general ideas are the same. And, honestly, this version is probably better because it doesn't include any attempts at improvised jokes; it just includes badly written jokes.</p> 
<p>The slides include speaker notes. The Transcript file contains all the dialogue from the presentation.</p>
