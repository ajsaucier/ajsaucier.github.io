WEBVTT

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hello, and thank you very much for attending my talk today,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.840
which is called "Don't Prioritize Color Over Content."

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.040
My name is Adam Saucier, 
and I'm a Senior Accessibility Engineer at TPGI.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.520
I started in digital accessibility in 2013 
when I was working as a web developer at an

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.840
advertising agency, building websites
for a large health insurance company.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.820
I then worked at a community college, 
managing their website and helping faculty members

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.480
create accessible course content, 
things like PDFs, videos, and other content.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.640
I myself have a color vision deficiency, 
which does not have a cure.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.200
The colorblind glasses that you might have seen advertised 
do not work and are similar

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.520
to accessibility overlays because they actually make the issue worse.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.700
I remember being unofficially diagnosed with a color vision deficiency or color blindness

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.840
by my sister when we were both young, when she would make fun of me
for picking the wrong color crayon out of the box.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.120
This was followed by an official diagnosis some years later when my automatrist said,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.280
"Yes, you are very colorblind."

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.280
There are approximately 350 million colorblind people in the world, give or take, making

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.600
the issue of a use of color a more impactful one than some might think.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.080
The three types of color vision deficiencies are red-green, which is the most common, and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.400
where certain shades of green look more red, or you can't even tell red and green apart

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.840
at all, blue-yellow, where it's difficult or impossible to tell blue and green, purple

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.360
and red, and yellow and pink apart, and complete color deficiency, where you can't see any

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.760
colors at all.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.360
This one is very rare.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.920
On this slide is an example of the color plate test, a very common method of testing for

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.120
color blindness when you go to an optometrist.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.060
It's made up of a large circle, which itself is made up of smaller circles that are a bunch

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.880
of different colors and different hues of the same color.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.360
If you clearly see a number two in this jumble of colors, 
you might not be colorblind.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.800
If you do not see a number, then you might be colorblind.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.400
I myself am not an optometrist, clearly, so if you are curious about whether or not you're

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.360
colorblind, you should go to your eye doctor and have a full test done.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.640
Here is a classic angry girlfriend meme, 
because every presentation needs at least one meme.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.240
The girl walking toward the camera has the text "pretty colors" overlaid on her.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.080
The boyfriend who looks back longingly at her has the text "many designers" and his

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.040
upset girlfriend has the text "content."

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.120
The point here is that many designers think about how colors make something look nice

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.280
without considering the effect they might have on the content itself.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.200
The WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color is a level A criterion that affects not only

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.480
those who are colorblind, but also those with low vision 
who have a difficult time distinguishing

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.920
certain visual elements.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.880
It's worth noting that this criterion did not change at all 
between WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.120
Now before I go any further, I just wanted to warn you all that I am an untrustworthy

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.440
source of information.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.960
According to Sarah Barreilles and her Broadway show The Waitress, one of the stars in the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.560
show sings the lyrics "He could be colorblind.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.680
How untrustworthy is that?" when referring to someone she might go on a date with.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.280
So take everything I say here with a grain of salt.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.080
I'm just joking here, Sarah Barreilles is an amazing singer and songwriter, and The Waitress

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.880
is a great musical.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.280
I'll just have to ask her what she means by that line,
if I ever come across her in real life.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.600
The next few slides will show some examples of color being used as the only method of

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600
showing information.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.880
A simple example that you'll see in the next slide is a link that is distinguished from

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.900
its adjacent text with an underline, which is the default HTML style.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.320
If this underline is removed and only the color is used, it can easily become a failure

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.920
of the success criterion and cause a serious issue for many users who won't be able to

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.600
tell between what text is a link and what text is not.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.880
Here are a couple paragraphs just with lorem ipsum text.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.520
The first paragraph contains a link that uses only color, but still technically passes criterion  1.4.1

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.520
because the contrast ratio between the link text and the non-link text is greater than 3 to 1.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.160
But just because you can do something often doesn't mean that you should.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.240
The link in the second paragraph has the same color text along with an underline, which

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.720
makes the difference much clearer.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.340
There is a WCAG technique that even suggests to at least add an underline to the link when

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.440
it is hovered over if you still choose to use only color to distinguish the link.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.520
Form field error validation is another classic example of using color as the only way to

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.120
present information.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.880
Fortunately, its solution is incredibly straightforward.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.680
As you'll hear quite a bit throughout the presentation, using text along with or instead

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.120
of color is often the best solution to making sure your design is accessible to those with

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.320
low vision or color vision deficiency.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.400
The first example in this slide fails the success criterion 1.4.1 because a global error

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.060
message appears at the top of the form that says, "Please fix the errors below."

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.800
"Fields in error have a red border."

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.640
Other than the field also being empty, its dark red border is the only difference between

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.760
the field that has an error and the field that does not.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.120
In the second example, which passes the success criterion, the field in error also has a text

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.680
message below it that says, "Please enter your first name."

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.840
This next example shows a star rating system on a shopping website that you might be familiar with.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.520
It shows five possible stars, three and a half of which are filled with an orange color,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.180
and the remaining one and a half are empty.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.920
The contrast ratio between the fill color and its adjacent non-filled color is less than

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.200
three to one, so something more than just color needs to be used here.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.320
The only other information presented in text is the total number of ratings for this product,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320
which is 32.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.840
But that number does not tell users how many of the stars are actually filled versus not

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.120
filled, and therefore how many stars the rating has, whether it's a good product or

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.200
a decent product or a not so good product.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.440
Many possible solutions to this problem are shown here.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.720
The first example shows the same exact group of five stars, but the color of the filled

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.840
stars has been darkened quite a bit and therefore has more contrast between the filled stars

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.280
and the unfilled ones.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.360
This increase in hue makes it easier to tell which stars are filled and which are empty.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.560
Even more importantly, text has also been added below the stars that provides the number of

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.680
filled stars, 3.5.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.000
The second example is taken straight from Google Reviews and has not been changed since the

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.620
number of filled stars, 4.8, is provided in text right before the stars themselves.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.920
The third and fourth examples come from a section of a WCAG understanding document for

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:17.120
a different criterion, 1.4.11 non-text contrast, where the relationship between these two criterions

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.240
is discussed.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.680
Both of these examples pass the use of color criterion because the black fill has a very

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:32.040
strong contrast against the not filled ones, and the border of the filled stars is thicker

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.920
than the non-filled stars in the final example, even though the yellow color of the filled

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.320
stars has very low contrast with just a white background.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:50.800
The thickened border here acts as an additional visual identifier.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.680
Now I'll move on to my personal favorite way to test the use of color in a design.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.080
Making the page grayscale and checking if the content can still be understood visually.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.200
While actual full color blindness or monochromacy is incredibly rare, you don't necessarily

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.480
need to have this condition to be affected by an over-reliance on colors in a design.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.600
For example, my wife applies a color filter to her phone's display to make everything

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.860
monochrome or grayscale, which she says makes her less likely to get distracted by her phone

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.180
during the work day.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:32.920
This means any content that relies on only color to make sense will also be lost on her.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.080
This is a simple bar graph created in Microsoft Excel with five bars that are all different

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.680
colors and do not have a text label below each bar to show their meaning.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.680
To the right of these bars is a legend that only refers to the color of each bar in order

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.240
to associate their meaning.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.160
I don't think it's too unreasonable to say that this is not great design, but it is also

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.160
very common for a bar graph.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.400
Here is the same bar graph as before, but it's now in grayscale, where all the bars

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.320
and their associated legend elements are just shades of gray.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.200
While maybe it can be argued that since the order of each bar from left to right matches

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.960
the order of each item in the legend from top to bottom, the bars can be understood

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.880
without using color.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.440
But that is not guaranteed to always be the case.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.400
It probably rarely ever is.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.940
And it also adds a lot of unnecessary cognitive load that users should not have to deal with

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:36.120
when they're just trying to get information from a bar graph.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.720
Here is that same exact bar graph again, but instead of only being distinguishable by color,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:48.600
the bars and legend now use distinct patterns to associate the meaning of each bar.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.560
While the patterns might be difficult to see on this slide, they consist of dots, dashes,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.480
horizontal and diagonal lines within each bar.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.960
Their color here doesn't matter at all.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.800
And here's that same bar graph once again, it's the last time, I promise, but in grayscale.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.200
Ideally the legend icons here would be larger to more easily see the patterns inside of

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.160
them, but this is Microsoft Excel.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.560
The point is that the bars can now be distinguished based on only their patterns, whether they

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.900
are filled with colors or just shades of gray.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.760
Because once again, the patterns within the bars are the only things that matter.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.600
Very nice.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.880
Line graphs are another common place to see only color used in a legend to differentiate

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.880
each data point.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.180
And that can be solved in a similar way as the bar graph example.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.240
This example shows two possible solutions combined into one line graph.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.520
Text labels that point at their respective lines and each line is composed of a different pattern.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.320
If you only wanted to use the text labels pointing at the lines, that would be fine.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.400
And if you only wanted to have the lines made up of different patterns and use a legend,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.000
that would also be fine.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.340
But it works here to use both.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.880
This feels like a perfect time to show that meme of a young girl raising her shoulders

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.120
inquisitively and asking, "why not both?"

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.360
But I think I've already gone over the meme limit here.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.840
Speaking of line graphs, this is a good example and possibly also a cruel joke.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.680
It's from the Wikipedia page dedicated to congenital red-green color blindness.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.580
This is a line graph on that page that shows the luminous efficiency function, which I'll

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.160
try to quickly explain.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.160
Since color blindness affects the eye's sensitivity as a function of a wavelength, like the one

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.080
shown here, it shifts the response time of a person's eye to make it more or less sensitive

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.280
to the light from certain wavelengths.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.840
People who are colorblind are less sensitive to lights at certain parts of this wavelength

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.200
and therefore have a harder time seeing the colors at these wavelengths correctly.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:09.060
If that doesn't make much sense, I'm sorry, it doesn't to me either, but blame Wikipedia.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.920
The reason this might be a cruel joke is because the lines of the graph use only color, red

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.280
and green.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.200
This is the same line graph from Wikipedia shown in the previous slide, but as of a couple

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.200
months ago, it was fixed by a colorblind person to give the lines different patterns, dotted,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.680
dashed and solid.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.040
If only that person chose a better color for the green dashed line, which has an extremely

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.560
low contrast with its adjacent white color.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:47.680
I'll now just quickly go back to the cognitive load that I mentioned in a previous slide.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.200
The previous line graph showing the text labels pointing directly at each line is a great

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.520
example of data being easier to parse when text is used instead of colors or even patterns.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.080
Often times, the simplest solution is the best one, and using text labels is really

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.460
as simple as it gets.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.760
Even when patterns can make charts and graphs perceivable for more people, they still require

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.820
the user to look back and forth between the chart and legend, and they need to remember

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.140
what pattern and data points are associated.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:23.120
This adds to cognitive load, and while sometimes necessary, if the text labels are too long

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.020
or complex to fit anywhere within the chart, it's still best to consider the text label

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.960
first and use that if possible.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.080
While reading an article recently about the environmental impact of downloaded versus

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.840
physical versus cloud-based media, which is a very interesting but unrelated topic, I

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.200
came across a few different types of graphs and charts.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.640
The next few slides will go over these real-world examples of the use of color on the web.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.200
Keep in mind that these also have issues with text contrast and text alternatives, but try

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:05.600
to focus on just how colors are used visually to convey the information.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.740
This first chart on the page was a very interesting one.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.680
The caption directly below this graphic refers to multiple things, color and position, referring

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.560
to elements that are red on the left, or blue and on the right.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.680
They're also labeled in text as upstream activities and downstream activities, ultimately making

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.260
the reference to colors unnecessary.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.120
This would pass the criterion.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.740
But the circles added to the image by the author are more of a concern.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.400
Right below the graphic and its caption, the author states, "Last time we looked at all

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.920
the parts of game production circled in red.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.960
This time, we're looking at the parts circled in blue."

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.480
This sentence does not reference these elements in any other way, such as using the text label

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.440
for each of the circled elements.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.280
Since all the reader has to go by here is the color that the author used for each circle,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.360
this would fail the criterion.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:14.040
The next example has some type of bar graph/pi chart hybrid thing, where there is an x-axis

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:22.100
with number of hours playing game and game file size in gigabytes on the y-axis.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:28.680
Three different sections fill the entire graph area, each with their own background color.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.840
Cloud gaming, disk gaming, and download gaming.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.500
Since each of these sections also has its own text label within it, it passes the use

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.760
of color criterion.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.680
The text contrast is insufficient though, so that would need to be improved in order

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.940
to pass that criterion.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:53.120
The final example from this article is a fairly standard bar graph with ten different groups

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.120
of vertical bars along the x-axis.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.200
Each group has a text below it, but the little bars within each group, of which there are

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.760
six, are only distinguished with color based on a legend below the graph.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.080
Some of these colors are extremely similar to each other.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.680
Since the bars are also very close together and there is not much space for a text label

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:20.640
for each, a distinct pattern for each bar would be probably the best solution here.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.760
If the graph was an interactive element and not entirely embedded in an image, there would

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.920
also be the option to make each bar hoverable with a mouse and focusable with a keyboard,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.840
which would show a tool tip that exposes a label for each bar.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.160
That would suffice as an additional visual indicator.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.560
Providing an accessible alternative is often a good way to provide content for users where

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.880
a certain format is required, such as a complex chart or graph, but is overly difficult to

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.720
make fully accessible.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.120
In the following example from Wikipedia, the content is provided in multiple ways.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.880
One is very inaccessible since it is an image with embedded text that uses only color, but

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:08.560
most of the same information is provided in an unordered list and a data table.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.040
Here is an interesting timeline graph contained in an embedded image on Wikipedia that shows

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.560
the lineup of a band from 1999 to 2023.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.320
The Y axis has the name of each band member and the X axis has the years that the band

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320
has been active.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.560
A horizontal bar for each band member shows how long they are in the band for and the

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.960
instrument they played is shown by the color of the bar and referenced in a legend below

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.420
the graph.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.520
The color issue could be easily solved by adding the band member's instrument next to

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.800
the name on the Y axis, but since the same information is already provided in an unordered

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.280
list above the graph, this might not be necessary.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.120
This is the unordered list that I referred to in the previous slide that contains the

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.600
same exact information as the graph, showing the members separated by current and former

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.880
along with their instrument and years active in the band.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.440
The information about the number of EPs and studio albums is also provided in a data table

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.280
in the discography section of the page.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.380
The next slide will show an edited version of the band member graph that is accessible

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:23.640
for colorblind users and has all the information in one place, because why not?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.480
Here is the same graph showing the members of the band throughout the years, but every

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.800
horizontal bar is the same color and the instruments are added as text next to each member's name

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.520
on the Y axis.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.720
The type of album released in certain years, EP or studio album, is also labeled with text

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.160
pointing to each vertical line.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.860
This is also referenced using only color in the original graph.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.580
The best of both worlds are provided here, a simple unordered list and table that contains

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.480
all the same information and a graph with that same information that does not rely on

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.680
colors at all.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.760
The next few slides will show a few more classic examples of color being used incorrectly on

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.240
the web.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.300
This is an interactive seating chart for a theater.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.360
All seats in the theater are represented by circles.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.880
Any circles filled with black are available for purchase and the gray circles are unavailable.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.400
There are also two seats somewhere in the theater that have been selected for purchase

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400
already.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.160
Can you find them?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.440
If you were able to spot those seats, congratulations, you have the vision of Superman.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.960
For me anyway, it was impossible to tell which seats had already been selected.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.040
This slide shows the same exact seat selector, but with the selected seats contained in a

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.640
blue rectangle to more clearly point them out.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.320
This quite clearly fails the use of color criterion and is just difficult

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.320
for people in general to use.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.280
This is a much more accessible way to show a seating chart.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.320
The only thing missing here is the legend that shows the meaning of each type of pattern,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.480
whether it's filled, empty, or with dashed lines.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.960
There are different colors being used here, but they do not mean much since each seating

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.360
section is also labeled with text over on the left side.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:21.320
This is taken from an article called "Accessibility Theater" from a TPGI colleague, Doug Abrams.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.540
This was another interesting example I came across in a native app.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:31.180
It's in a travel booking app when a user is scheduling their stay.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.040
Only color is being used to distinguish the different price ranges of certain dates, cheaper,

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.520
average, or higher than usual.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.720
This is great information to know when trying to decide when to schedule a trip, but unfortunately

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.840
the only things providing this information are very similar background colors.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.620
Using patterns within these dates might be a challenge since they might conflict with

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.420
the number itself.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.160
In this case, the pattern would need to be very simple, and the number would need to

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.240
maintain strong contrast against it.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.300
Next up, I'll go through a few more examples that I've come across either in the real world

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.120
or around places online, such as Reddit.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.960
I want to point out just how common it is to come across designs where color is used

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.200
as the one and only way to understand information.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.240
It goes far beyond just graphs, charts, and form fields.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.500
This first example found on Reddit is a map of China's many counties, separated with different

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.560
colors that represent the predominant religion in that county.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.440
Not only is color the only thing being used here, but some of the colors are extremely

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.600
similar and might be hard to tell apart even for people with no color vision deficiency

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.320
at all.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.560
Since some of these counties are incredibly small, would using different patterns work

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560
here?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.080
I don't think so.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.400
I would recommend adding text directly below the image with a heading for each religion,

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.600
followed by an unordered list containing the name of each county where that religion is

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600
predominant.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.960
It would be a very long list, so each one should be contained in a collapsible component

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.080
if vertical space is a concern.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.440
Here's a screen from a toddler's lesson on YouTube, from a creator called Ms. Rachel,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.920
with a Christmas tree that has four ornaments of different colors.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.320
The question for the student is, which ornament is purple?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:28.360
Now, I'm not a parent or a teacher, so I could be off base here, but it seems inconsiderate

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.080
at the least to ask this question.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.560
Kids can be colorblind too, after all.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.120
Why not ask about the color and the symbol on the ornament?

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.320
Each ornament already has a unique graphic on it.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.480
Maybe something like, which ornament is purple and has a snowflake with six points?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.640
Does that give away the answer too easily, or make it too difficult?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.800
I'm not really sure, but if the child already has difficulty telling apart purple and blue,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.480
the original question is already flawed.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.680
Many of the comments on this thread mention that colorblind people just assume that the

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:07.280
one with the darker hue is purple, when they need to compare purple and blue.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.880
I can tell from experience that this doesn't always work, but it is an interesting approach.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.440
Here's something from Out in the Real World, on a real piece of paper.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.480
It's a little word puzzle called Wave Words, where it asks the user, "What are these colorful

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.640
fish trying to spell out?"

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.480
Use the key below to reveal the answer.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.480
Two rows of fish with the same exact shape but different colors each make up a letter

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.840
in the phrase, which has two words in it.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.880
Below that is a key with many different colored fish and the letter they represent.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.960
The problem here is that all the fish are exactly the same size and shape, meaning only

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.760
the color can be used to tell them apart.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.480
The first solution I can think of is to use some different sea creatures with different

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480
shapes.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:01.140
Whales, dolphins, octopus, jellyfish, crabs, there's so many options here.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.840
This is a companion planting chart, where 30 plants are shown with their relationships

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.560
to other plants.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.240
Whether they grow well when planted next to each other, if their combination would help

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.400
with bug control, if they shouldn't be planted anywhere near one another, and so on.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.080
There are many ways to present this information, but this designer chose to use a key where

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.160
colors represent their relationships with the main plant in question.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:31.240
For example, in the broccoli section, the text for tomatoes is red, which means broccoli

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.960
and tomatoes should not be planted together.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.640
For gardeners, this is pretty vital information that could lead to bad results in the food

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.200
they grow for themselves and their families.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.480
Relying on just different colored text here can potentially have a very real impact.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.400
Don't even get me started on screen reader interactivity here.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.520
Unless a lot of visually hidden content is attached to the name of every plant in order

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.200
to tell assistive technology users how they relate to other plants, this chart could be

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.880
completely useless to these users.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.120
And here's a table showing very similar information as the previous one, but this time it's presented

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:15.280
in a table with plant, companion, enemy, and additional info column headers.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.720
Colors are not relied upon at all here, and the different associations between the plants

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.640
can be seen just from the table's structure.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.160
Screen reader users can also understand this information in the table, assuming it's marked

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.940
up correctly.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.840
This isn't a PDF, so odds are likely that it's not marked up with the correct tags,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.240
but that's a different topic for a whole different presentation.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.560
Moving into a slightly different topic for a little while, this slide shows two images

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.240
of the board game Ticket to Ride.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.960
Colors are certainly a factor here, since players need to claim certain routes on the

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.840
board based on the color of their game piece.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.320
But each route is also distinguished by a distinct shape.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.480
Each card that the player uses to lay out their route has a shape in all four corners

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.000
that corresponds to each available route on the board.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.120
This gives players an option to use color or shape to work out the route and play the

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.120
game.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:17.860
Now we'll go a little bit beyond board games and go into traveling in the real world.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.320
Public transportation is used by millions of people, so you would think that more focus

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:26.960
would be put on making sure their maps are accessible for as many riders as possible.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.480
In some cases, this is true, thankfully.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.960
But in the case of London's Tube map specifically, which will be shown in the next slide, this

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.160
is not the case.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.560
Shown here is a very small piece of the London Tube map, along with a large version of the

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.240
map's legend.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.200
Colorblind riders of the London Tube cannot easily tell the difference between the colors

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.360
and the legend, so you'll find it very difficult to know which line is which on the map.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.040
That's a big problem.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.680
While those who ride it every day will most likely adjust to this and remember which lines

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.840
go where after riding them so many times, it's still a big problem for visitors and

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.760
many other colorblind people who don't ride these rails every day and just need to get

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.080
from point A to point B.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.080
Here's a small section of the London Tube map, the same section shown on the previous

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.600
slide where I at least as close as I could get to it, but this version is fully black

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.680
and white and uses only patterns in its legend to distinguish each line.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.760
This is provided by Transport for London.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.640
It has a legend very similar to the colored version than the previous one, but only different

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.600
patterns are used.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.000
While this is still a complex map with many overlapping lines and different patterns,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.960
it's definitely an improvement for colorblind travelers since it does not rely on color

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.880
at all.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.080
In contrast to the London Underground map, the New York City Subway map uses numbers,

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.880
letters, shapes, and even lines with distinct patterns depending on whether it's a train,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.680
bus, or commuter rail.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.560
It can still be overwhelming for those of us who don't live in New York City and use

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.080
it every day, but that's more of a general problem.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.280
You can be just as confused by this gigantic map and its legend whether you're colorblind

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280
or not.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280
Isn't that fun?

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:21.720
In the final few slides for my presentation, we'll be looking at a couple of very popular

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.320
puzzle video games that use color.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.240
One of them is an arcade and console game from 1996, and the other is a mobile game

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240
from 2019.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.960
You can probably guess which of the two has accessibility options that make it more playable

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.320
for those who cannot distinguish colors.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.280
When I first tried playing Puzzle Fighter II as a kid, which is a puzzle game where

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.000
you need to clear the board by aligning gems of the same color to make them disappear,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.120
sort of a spin-off, a puzzle version of Street Fighter II, the gems just weren't disappearing

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.680
even though I thought I was matching them up correctly.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.920
I just took it as a sign that the game was broken and walked away frustrated.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.360
There were plenty of other games to play.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.920
After trying it again recently as an adult, I asked my wife if I was placing the correct

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.000
yellow pieces next to each other.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.600
She said some were yellow and some were bright green.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.280
Here's a zoomed-in example of the gems from Puzzle Fighter II.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.000
All four different colored square gems are shown here, other than the one special circular

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
gem.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.760
You can see how these gems look exactly the same aside from their different colors.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:37.120
To my eyes, there are only three distinct colors here, red, yellow, and blue.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.480
While the console version of this game has options for adjusting the difficulty of the

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.960
AI and how quickly the gems fall into the play area from the top, there are no options

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.000
to make the gems easier to tell apart for colorblind users.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.720
Making them into differently shaped gems would be one very helpful option.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.240
On the other hand, this newer game called Grindstone, another puzzle game where players

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.560
need to clear the board by matching items of the same color, has a lot of accessibility

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.200
baked right into its design.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.120
Each monster has a very distinct design with different shapes and colors.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.520
When a certain type of monster is chosen, the rest of the board becomes much darker,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.160
only keeping monsters of that same type really noticeable and bright.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.800
This not only helps colorblind players, but it's a nice option to make the game a little

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:32.200
bit easier to play in general for beginners or those who just want to play it more casually.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.280
This design choice does not change the gameplay at all, and is an option that can be turned

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.680
off or set to a lower difference in contrast.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.360
This slide shows the same screenshots from the previous one, but this time they're in

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.000
grayscale, just to show that each puzzle piece can still be distinguished even when color

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.600
is no longer a factor.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.240
Making this game more accessible with this option does not make it any less fun or dangerously

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.080
addicting.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.600
Many video game players like to argue about whether or not accessibility options should

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.920
be allowed within their video games.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.200
As they say, they make the game too easy, or they conflict with the designer's true

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.300
intentions.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.160
I find these arguments completely ridiculous.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.960
First of all, they're usually options that can be turned on or off.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.000
If you want a super difficult game, just don't use the options.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.920
Also, as shown in this game, they can be baked straight into the design and still be a fantastic

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:37.920
game that all players can enjoy, whether or not they're colorblind or have other disabilities.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.920
Now, because I can't possibly mention video games without bringing up the ultimate puzzle

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:49.440
game to ever exist, here is the original version of Tetris, designed and programmed in the

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.760
USSR in 1985 by Alexei Pajitnov.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.860
He was using an Electronica 60 computer with a monochrome display, so his design needed

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.160
to work with visual means other than just colors.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.240
What he ended up designing was Tetris, where various shapes called Tetraminos need to fit

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.840
together to clear lines, while more randomly fell from the top of the screen at increasing

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840
speeds.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.480
I'm assuming most people here have at least heard of Tetris by now, if not played it,

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.440
for hundreds and hundreds of hours.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.800
The Tetramino blocks in the original version are all made up of simple pairs of square

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.400
brackets.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.200
Over the years, colors have been added to these blocks and the game has been modernized

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.320
in some ways, but never has color been a major part of the game, which has sold, by the way,

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.040
about 520 million copies.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.480
So to wrap things up for my presentation, I'd like to summarize just a few things regarding

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.240
the use of color in design.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.780
Of course, color should be used in your design, they just need to be considered and not be

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.240
the only thing that conveys content.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.080
When designing your next project, consider how different shapes, patterns, or text labels

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.760
can be used alongside colors.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:12.200
When creating content, remember not to use instructions like "click the green link"

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.560
or "the field of the red border" is an error.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.280
For many more examples of this, refer to the article on the TPGI blog titled "Well Color

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:29.880
Us Surprised, This SC Can Be a Tricky Customer" from the great TPGI colleague Ian Lloyd.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.280
Thank you very much, and I'd like to answer any questions that you might have.
