  A story about brain surgery to remove a cavernous angioma and the events that
  led up to it
---
It’s been almost exactly a year since getting a cavernous angioma removed in awake craniotomy. Over 12 months almost all the scar scabs are almost gone,but the scar is still there and always admired by barbers. I think it might be worth sharing the experience with others planning for it personally or with family and friends who are.



My first tonic-clonic (aka grand mal) seizure happened the night of January 6, 2017 while I was asleep. I never imagined I’d experience something like that, after reading the harrowing graphic novel Epileptic by David Beauchard a decade ago. I had four more following that, with the last one happening in May 2017. Compared to the visualization of the graphic novel, mine were relatively uneventful internally. I’m not sure what others experience during episodes, but I don’t remember anything during mine other than the very beginning, middle and end.
