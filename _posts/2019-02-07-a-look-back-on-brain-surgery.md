  A story about brain surgery to remove a cavernous angioma and the events that
  led up to it
---
It’s been almost exactly a year since getting a cavernous angioma removed in awake craniotomy. Over 12 months almost all the scabs are gone, but the scar is still there and always admired by barbers. I think it might be worth sharing the experience with others planning for it.

By the time six months went by and seizures were still happening - even though they weren’t all major ones - I made up my mind to get the angioma removed. Instead of living with the fear that seizures could keep happening and with the benefit of its location making surgery possible at all, it seemed like a no-brainer.

When I first started discussing it with the surgeon - a brilliant guy who was somehow able to bring his intelligence down a few pegs to make me understand this stuff - I was given a couple options. Because the angioma lived on an accessible part of my brain that controlled language processing (the left temporal lobe), I would need to be conscious while parts of the procedure happened so I could show that I still functioned and he wouldn’t be removing the important bits. He’d be mapping out my brain in real time.

The other option allows for the patient to be asleep during the whole procedure, but the surgery would need to take place in two segments. It would be the better option for someone who doesn't want to be awake at all with their skull opened, but the risk of infection would be higher. For that reason, being awake during the surgery seemed like the way to go.

## Preparation

Angioma Alliance has a great [article outlining every step in the process](http://angioma.org/pages.aspx?content=77&id=67), from preparing your finances and family right up to what to do in the operating room. It's definitely worth it to read through this.
