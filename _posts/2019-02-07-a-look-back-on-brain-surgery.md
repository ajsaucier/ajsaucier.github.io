  A story about brain surgery to remove a cavernous angioma and the events that
  led up to it
---
It’s been almost exactly a year since getting a cavernous angioma removed in awake craniotomy. Over 12 months almost all the scabs are gone, but the scar is still there and always admired by barbers. I think it might be worth sharing the experience with others planning for it.

By the time six months went by and seizures were still happening - even though they weren’t all major ones - I made up my mind to get the angioma removed. Instead of living with the fear that seizures could keep happening and potentially cause brain damage and with the benefit of its location making surgery possible, it seemed like a no-brainer.

When I first started discussing it with the surgeon - a brilliant guy who was somehow able to bring his intelligence down a few pegs to make me understand this stuff - I was given a couple options. Because the angioma lived on an accessible part of my brain that controlled language processing (the left temporal lobe), I would need to be conscious while parts of the procedure happened so I could show that I still functioned and he wouldn’t be removing the important bits. He’d be mapping out my brain in real time.

The other option allows for the patient to be asleep during the whole procedure, but the surgery would need to take place in two segments a few days apart. It would be the better option for someone who doesn't want to be awake at all with their skull opened, but the risk of infection would be higher. For that reason, being awake during the surgery seemed like the way to go.

## Preparation

Angioma Alliance has a great [article outlining every step in the surgery process](http://angioma.org/pages.aspx?content=77&id=67), from preparing your finances and family right up to what to do in the operating room. It's definitely worth it to read through this.

The most important thing I can recommend is to not think too much about it. As a person who almost passes out just thinking about getting blood drawn, it really helped me to keep it at a good distance. Try not to talk about it every day with family and friends. That helped me see it as just a regular medical procedure not anything to flip out about when the day finally came.

## Day Before

Your surgeon and his/her assistant will give you all the details about things like washing your hair and fasting the night before the surgery. I remember the anti-bacterial shampoo I used for two nights before the surgery (Hibiclens) feeling like pouring rubbing alcohol on my head.

It's a good idea to stay in a hotel close to the hospital, if possible. It was snowing the night before my surgery was scheduled, so it avoided stressing about not being able to get there in time. 

Overall - as obvious as this is to say - just don't stress out about it. Feeling a little anxious is fine, but have confidence in your surgeon and think about how cool it'll be when you get to take a ton of photos of a big scar. Play a video game or solve some puzzles or do anything else that requires a lot of distraction and concentration the night before, and of course, sleep.

## Day Of

Unless you're a morning person (assuming your surgery is scheduled for early in the morning), you'll probably be too tired to worry too much about the surgery coming up. The process really starts when you're laying down with the stylish gown and getting the IVs stuck in your hand and arms. After you say bye to whoever walked with you into the pre-op area, you'll be wheeled into the operating room. I'm not sure if everybody shares this view, but this place is just really cool. 

Going through some white hallways to suddenly busting into a huge room with a bunch of people wearing goggles and masks is kind of euphoric.  The surgeon asked me if I'd prefer to have him shave my whole head or just the necessary part. I was still conscious enough to think about how it would be an endless struggle to have one part of my hair growing back at a different length than the rest of it and how it might never be an even length again, unless it was all shaved off anyway. So I decided to have it all shaved; I think the surgeon agreed. 

Before the haircut (and the rest of the surgery) I was laid down on the surgical bed and talked to by the anesthetist. Before being put out, I'm pretty sure I was turned onto my right side and started having a conversation with the assistant who was there with me the whole time. I was for a period of time, so I thankfully missed the inserting of the catheter, the opening of my skull and all that good stuff.
