  A story about brain surgery to remove a cavernous angioma and the events that
  led up to it
---
It’s been almost exactly a year since getting a cavernous angioma removed in awake craniotomy. Over 12 months almost all the scar scabs are almost gone,but the scar is still there and always admired by barbers. I think it might be worth sharing the experience with others planning for it personally or with family and friends who are.

My first tonic-clonic (aka grand mal) seizure happened the night of January 6, 2017 while I was asleep. I never imagined I’d experience something like that, after reading the harrowing graphic novel Epileptic by David Beauchard a decade ago. I had four more following that, with the last one happening in May 2017. Compared to the visualization of the graphic novel, mine were relatively uneventful internally. I’m not sure what others experience during episodes, but I don’t remember anything during mine other than the very beginning, middle and end.

## Beginning

When I was awake and a seizure was starting, there was always a very distinct feeling, an aura, happening a few seconds before it began. It’s common for epileptics to experience the same type of aura before every seizure. Mine was a complete loss of ability to speak or understand anything, followed by my head physically turning and locking to my right side, all happening within seconds.



When a minor seizure happened - which was frequent even while taking meds - it would be tough to understand, read or speak for a few seconds, which would come and go quickly. Nothing major, and it became so common that it felt like something that had been happening my whole life.

## Middle

Becoming conscious after a seizure was always strange. After waking up dazed in the ambulance after the first one, I started getting used to being half-conscious and realizing after a few minutes what was happening. Plus, needles and IV stuck in when I was unconscious made that stuff bearable. 

I’d get the different medications being taken at the time into IV along with the usual liquids. 

By the time my neurologist got to the right amount of meds (I’m weaning off them now), I arrived at lots of Vimpat and Keppra.

## End

There isn’t a whole lot to think about when lying in a hospital bed after a seizure subsides. There are feelings of exhaustion and a sadness that it happened again. I also felt a lot of guilt that other people - usually my wife, dad or both - had to deal with this at all. Driving me to work, picking me up at the bus stop, driving me back and forth to the neurologist; the list goes on. I remember another big emotion being anger that the countdown to when I could drive again started all over again.



Speaking of remembering - my memory started getting bad after the first seizure. It could be from the episodes or medications or both. It might not happen at all for some, depending on where the angioma is and where on the brain it bleeds.

## Surgery

By the time six months went by and seizures were still happening - even though they weren’t major ones - I made up my mind to get the angioma removed. Instead of living with the fear that seizures could keep happening and with the benefit of its location making surgery possible at all, it seemed like a no-brainer. 



The factors behind the decision will never be exactly the same for any two people when considering those factors on top of their health insurance, location, other health conditions, and so on. If you do have the opportunity to have a surgery like this and are on the fence about it though, you might want to keep reading.



When I first started discussing it with the surgeon - a brilliant (obviously) guy who was somehow able to bring his intelligence down a few pegs to make me understand this stuff - I was given a couple options. Because the angioma lived on an accessible part of my brain that controlled language processing (the left temporal lobe, to all you brain nerds out there), I would need to be conscious while parts of the procedure happened so I could show that I still functioned and he wouldn’t be removing the important bits. He’d be mapping out my brain in real time.



The other option allows for the patient to be asleep during the whole surgery, but for the surgery to take place in two segments. I’d be put to sleep while a section of the brain is removed, it would be placed in a freezer or something, he would do something to it...you know that? I won’t pretend to know anything about this choice. The thought of having my skull opened, closed, then opened again and the risk of infection made me immediately discount this option. For some reason, being awake during the surgery seemed like the way to go.



As with most people, I read all over the internet about every aspect of awake craniotomy.
