While portable electronic devices have been a mainstay in at least half of my life and a constant source of either deep frustration or reserved satisfaction, I've never bothered to review one. Something about this one - the Lenovo Tab M8 FHD Android tablet - has inspired me to actually sit down and put together some thoughts about it. Not because it's necessarily mind-blowing, but because it's relatively affordable and actually worth the cost.

To mix metaphors, this tablet punches above its weight and really knocks it out of the park.
