While portable electronic devices have been a mainstay in at least half of my life and a constant source of either deep frustration or restrained satisfaction, I've never bothered to review one. Something about this one - the Lenovo Tab M8 FHD Android tablet - has inspired me to actually sit down and put together some thoughts about it. Not because it's necessarily mind-blowing, but because it's relatively affordable and actually worth the cost.

Before considering a device like this, it's important to know that it is not an iPad equivalent. It's about the same size as an iPad Mini, but doesn't run iPad OS and isn't from Apple. It doesn't support active pens or styluses, so it's not a great drawing or note-taking tablet. Its screen has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is bad news on a laptop but isn't problematic on this 8 inch tablet as long as you aren't using it as a laptop substitute (you aren't, are you?). 

I'll make an assumption that the main use of this tablet for a lot of people is reading books, streaming media and browsing the web. I've used it mostly for reading comics on Hoopla, books on Google Play Books, articles on the New York Times app, and even some magazines in text mode on the RB Digital app. For these tasks, it's a really great little device. 

I got the M8 FHD on sale from Lenovo's website for just under $100, mostly so I could have an Android device for testing with the TalkBack screen reader. The first thing I noticed after taking it out of the box and turning it on is that the screen is fully laminated. This was a big deal for me - the base level iPad at $329 doesn't have a laminated screen so I wasn't expecting that luxury from an Android tablet that's less than half that price. It really does make a difference when the text is closer to the screen

To mix metaphors, this tablet punches above its weight and knocks it out of the park.
